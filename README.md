# Intent Learning for Autonomous Systems

## Project Overview
This Final Year Project focuses on developing advanced intent learning and prediction systems for autonomous agents. The project combines multiple approaches including multi-agent systems, model predictive control (MPC), risk-aware planning, and state estimation techniques to create a robust framework for understanding and predicting agent behaviors.
